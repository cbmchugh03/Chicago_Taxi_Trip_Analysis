        "# Executive Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:**\n",
        "* The objective of this project was to pull out meaningful insights for Chicago-based taxi companies in order to help them make better decisions. These decisions include where they should place their fleets, what time of day yields the most tips for their drivers, and which hours of the day have the most passenger volumes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data:**\n",
        "* The data for this project utilizes the Chicago Taxi Trips dataset from BigQuery, focusing on trip details, fares, tips, payment types, and pickup/dropoff locations, amongst other things. The data for this project starts in April of 2017 and goes to the present day, being updated every Sunday. Some of the key variables used include total trip fare, pickup neighborhood, the pickup and drop off time stamps, and tip amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodology:**\n",
        "* The methodology I used for analysis was putting myself in the shoes of taxi company owners for whom this data would be helpful. I thought about what they would care about if they were paying someone to analyze this data for them. From this, I thought that doing exploratory data analysis on volume numbers and trip fare amounts would be valuable, as that is what would be important to the owner of a taxi company. To clean the data, NOT NULL was put into queries where applicable. Furthermore, many numbers had to be changed to numeric or other data types to allow for graphing. As for the graphs, I based them on the time of the trip, as the time of the day can be incredibly important for a taxi driver.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "*  I found that the average fare and tip are the highest during the morning, while the afternoon has much higher volumes of passengers. This could mean fewer taxis are available in the morning, thus allowing them to charge a higher fare, and more available in the afternoon for the higher volume. I also found that payment via cash was the most popular payment type for customers, but payment via credit card led to the highest amount of tips. Next, I found that Downtown Chicago ( Near North Side and the Loop) has the highest total passenger pickups by fair, with the other popular pickup locations still being in the 10s millions. Also, from my logistic regression model, I found that the company can heavily influence the payment type used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations:**\n",
        "* From these findings, I recommend that a taxi company have the most drivers ready early in the morning and later in the afternoon. Fares are the highest in the morning, so it would make sense to capitalize on those higher fares for the most profit. Furthermore, the afternoon has the highest total volume of passengers. While the fares may not be as high, the volume is much higher, still allowing for sufficient profit to be made. Also, I recommend that a company accept credit card payments as much as possible. Fares and tips via this payment type tend to be higher than any other payment type, allowing the driver and company to maximize profit. Lastly, I recommend a company that looks into serving the neighborhoods outside the downtown area. These areas still have 10s of millions of riders that may feel underserved, so a company could make a nice living serving these customers."

Due to how the code was written and how the logic determines am or pm, I could not get 12 pm and 12 am in the correct spots. This was troubleshooted for about 45 minutes, but no resolution was found. If you hover your cursor over any of the lines, it will tell you what that line is and the value of that line.

        " Early morning has the highest average fare by far, as there is a rush to get to work on time. People funnel out of the office at the end of the day, so the fare is not as significant. However, almost everyone needs to be in the office by 7/8 a.m., leading to a higher demand in the morning for a scarce resource, thus the reason for the higher fare. Furthermore, drivers are tipped more during this time, around 1.80 per trip, compared to the average of around 1.50 throughout the rest of the day. The fares stay stable throughout the day, dropping into the later hours of the night as there is less demand from drivers and a shorter trip duration. The shorter trip duration is likely due to people coming home from a night out and choosing to go somewhere near their homes to minimize the travel distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In conclusion, if a taxi company wants to position itself to make the most money per trip, it should be ready to have drivers between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. The rest of the day hovers around the same fares, peaking at 3 p.m., so a company should capitalize on these higher fares when possible. While the volume in the morning is not as high as the volume in the afternoon, on a per-trip basis, the morning is more profitable.\n"

        "* 5 p.m.-7 p.m. has the highest total passenger count over any 3 hours in the day. This range also includes the three highest total fare amounts based on the hour of the day. A company must have the most drivers ready to drive at this time, as it has the highest chance of having numerous passengers in a row and not having to drive around with an empty taxi. Drivers lose money any time they drive without a passenger, as the only way they get paid is if they have a paying customer in their cab. Maximizing the time a driver has a passenger is in the driver's best interest. Furthermore, a company can be prepared not to have as many drivers ready in the late hours/ early hours of the night/morning. The lower fare amount, mixed with the lower frequency, does not make it worth having a large fleet of drivers ready.\n",
        "\n",
        "* One interesting thing that this chart shows is that the most profitable time of the day is between the hours of 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., from a volume perspective, even though the average fare is not as high as earlier in the day. This is because the total number of passengers using taxis during this time is significantly higher than in the morning, leading to a lot more money moving around the city at these times. This shows that the most profitable time to be a driver is earlier in the morning since you are getting tipped more per customer and later in the afternoon since there is a larger volume of passengers. If a taxi company can only have 1 time of the day that it can run its fleet, it should be in the evening, between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.  "

A taxi company should have a higher proportion of their fleet in these two areas to capture the most amount of business they can. However, taxi companies should not overlook the other areas of the city. Companies should not ignore large frequencies, in the tens of millions, in these more suburban communities.\n"

        "* This bar chart shows users' payment preferences. The red chart shows how many people paid via that payment type, and the blue is the total money spent by that payment method. You can click on the legend and select which bar to view. Once you do this, you will see the total amount (nonlog scaled) displayed above the line. The axis is displayed on a log scale to make the chart better for analysis. This is the reason for the gap between 10 and 6 on the axis. One of the charts, the difference in magnitude is so large, to the point where the axis gets wierd to reflect this magnitude difference. This is on the user count graph, as it goes from 86 million people using credit card to 4 million people using mobile payment.\n",
        "* This chart tells us that even though more people pay with cash, more money is spent via credit card. About 30 million more users use cash over credit cards, but credit card users spend almost 500 million more on their fares. This is likely because credit card users are more likely to tip than any other payment type by a wide margin (see graph below). To maximize the amount of money a user spends on each trip, taxi companies should welcome using credit cards. Furthermore, a taxi company can only consider accepting credit cards or mobile payments to induce people to spend more money. Mobile payment types such as Cash App, Zelle, and Venmo are rapidly gaining popularity, so companies should be ready to adapt.\n"

        "**Analysis**\n",
        "* Supervised learning was applied to determine the likelihood of getting a tip based on the total trip amount, the trip time, and the hour of the trip, amongst other things. The model was able to predict the outcome of a tip with 91.25% accuracy. This high accuracy is likely due to the fact that there is a larger proportion of no-tip givens, leading the model to have a vast amount of data to predict when a driver will not get tipped. The highest contributors towards getting a tip are getting paid by credit card or mobile payment and how long the trip was. The highest things against getting a tip are getting paid in cash or by how short the trip was.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Precision, recall, and F-1 scores are all high, indicating the overall effectiveness of this model. This high performance is likely due to the large amount of training data, allowing the model to see numerous transactions resulting in tips/no tips. The precision on \"no tip\" is incredibly high, meaning a low number of false negatives for this class. Furthermore, the F1 score indicates that the model is equally as good at identifying both class categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This shows that tip is more dependent on the payment type than anything else. When paying with a credit card, it's often easier to include a few extra cents of a tip, as there may be an option on the screen to tip. With cash, there is no easy screen that shows tip percentages, so the passenger has to figure out how much of a tip to give manually. Furthermore, many cash users may just let the driver keep the change as their tip, which would result in many smaller tips.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Furthermore, when the payment method is Unknown, it's likely to result in no tips. This is because the \"Unknown\" payment types include rides that may have been canceled due to various reasons and rides that were free (training or promotional rides). These rides result in the passenger being upset with the taxi driver or not needing to tip them due to the nature of the ride. This leads to no tip given in these situations, thus the reason for the negative correlation."

        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "* Early morning trips (5 a.m.-7 a.m.) command the highest average fares, while evening rush hour (5 p.m.-7 p.m.) sees the highest trip volume.\n",
        "* Credit card payments contribute to higher overall revenue than cash, largely due to increased tipping.\n",
        "* Downtown areas, particularly Near North Side and The Loop, are the most popular pickup locations.\n",
        "* Specific taxi companies show stronger associations with certain payment types, suggesting potential marketing or operational strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Takeaways:**\n",
        "* **Demand and fares fluctuate throughout the day, requiring strategic driver allocation. A business must determine what metric (volume or revenue per tip) to prioritize to make the best strategic decision**\n",
        "* **Credit card adoption is crucial for maximizing revenue and tip collection.**\n",
        "* **While Downtown areas present the highest opportunities for passenger acquisition, the suburban areas should not be ignored. A company can make it their whole business model to serve these suburban customers and make a good living off of it**\n",
        "* **Company-specific payment preferences should be leveraged for targeted marketing. Certain taxi companies may only accept certain payment types. These companies can advertise their services to users of this payment type, encouraging customer growth.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations:**\n",
        "* Optimize driver availability during peak demand and high-fare periods to maximize revenue potential.\n",
        "* Incentivize credit card usage through promotions or loyalty programs to encourage higher spending and tips.\n",
        "* Focus marketing efforts on high-volume pickup areas and consider strategic partnerships with businesses in these locations.\n",
        "* Tailored payment options or promotions for specific companies could be explored to enhance customer experience and revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications for Decision-Making:**\n",
        "* These insights can inform driver scheduling, pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and payment system choices to optimize profitability and customer satisfaction.\n",
        "* Understanding passenger behavior and payment preferences can enable more targeted services and promotions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Future Directions:**\n",
        "* Investigating the impact of external factors like weather and events on trip patterns could further refine operational strategies.\n",
        "* Analyzing passenger demographics and preferences could unlock personalized services and marketing opportunities.\n",
        "* Exploring the use of predictive models to forecast demand and optimize resource allocation could enhance operational efficiency."
